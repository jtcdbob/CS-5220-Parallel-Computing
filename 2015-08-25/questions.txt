## How many are you?

In the first lecture, we ran a parallel protocol for counting attendance:

 - Rightmost person per row counts all in row
 - When done counting, raises hand
 - State number in row when called on

after which the instructor gets to gather and sum the row counts.

In practice, this took X time.  This includes

 - Time to start the process
 - Time to compute row counts
 - Time for the instructor to gather counts
 - Time for instructor to do the arithmetic

Consider the following questions:

1. What is a simple model that would predict this time?
2. What about a simple model to predict time for one person to count?
3. How big should the class be before the parallel method takes less time?

I. A simple model for the parallized counting will consist of
        a. Overhead time for counting, which includes starting time t_a_1, instructor gathering counts time t_a_2, instructor doing arithmetic time t_a_3.
        b. Students doing time each row t_b
   The total time will be 
                T = t_a_1 + (t_b + t_a_2) + t_a_3
II. The time for one student to count is approximately time to count each row times number of rows:
                T = (time per row) * (# of rows)
III. It is more efficient to use the parallel method when the total time in I is more than the total time in II. For a rough estimate, we assume the number of people in each row is the same, the rows needed is approximately
        (# of rows needed) = (t_a_1 + t_a_2 + t_a_3)/(time per row) + 1
  The number of people can be then calculated.
